# Foreign-Direct-Investment-Analysis

## **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows** across various **sectors and time periods** to uncover key investment trends and insights. Using **Python**, we explore sectoral distributions, yearly investment growth, and correlations between policy changes and investment patterns to provide data-driven recommendations for stakeholders and policymakers.  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset contains:  
- **Sector**: Industry or category receiving FDI  
- **Yearly FDI Inflows**: FDI investment for each financial year (2000-2017)  
- **Currency Conversion**: FDI values in both **USD and INR** for standardization  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (for data analysis and visualization)  
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** (for data visualization)  
- **Google Colab** (for execution and cloud storage integration)

## **Project Workflow**  

### **1. Data Loading**  
- Imported dataset from Google Drive  
- Displayed **summary statistics** and dataset structure  

### **2. Data Cleaning**    
- Handled **missing and duplicate values**
- Checked for **outliers** using statistical methods and adjusted data accordingly 

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Bar Charts for Sector-wise FDI** â†’ Identified **top investment sectors** such as **Services, Software, and Telecom**  
- **Line Charts for Yearly Trends** â†’ Showcased **increasing FDI growth post-2010**  
- **Scatter Plot for Sector-wise Trends** â†’ Analyzed **sectoral investment variations**  

### **4. Statistical Analysis**  
- **Correlation Matrix** â†’ Found strong **correlation between policy reforms and FDI growth**  
- **Key Financial Metrics** â†’ Computed **mean, median, and standard deviation** for sector-wise analysis  

### **5. Top Sectors Analysis**  
- Extracted **Top 10 Sectors** based on **FDI inflows**  
- **Bar Chart Visualization** showcased **leading industries in attracting foreign investment**

## **Key Findings**  
ðŸ“Œ **Services Sector Dominance:** Accounts for **17% of total FDI inflows**, indicating strong investor confidence.  
ðŸ“Œ **Policy Impact:** **Regulatory reforms and economic stability** drive FDI growth patterns.  
ðŸ“Œ **Sectoral Variations:** While **software and telecom receive high FDI**, sectors like **coal and defense** show lower investment.  
ðŸ“Œ **Investment Trends:** Increasing **post-2010 FDI inflows** highlight the importance of **government policies and globalization**.

## **Future Scope**  
âœ… Implement **predictive modeling** to forecast sector-wise FDI growth.  
âœ… Introduce **outlier detection** to identify investment anomalies.  
âœ… Expand the dataset to **include post-2017 investment trends**.
